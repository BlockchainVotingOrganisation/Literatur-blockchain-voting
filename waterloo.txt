Reading Course: On the potential for blockchain-based solutions to voting 
Urs Hengartner (Waterloo) & Jeremy Clark (Concordia)

This course will examine the intersection of voting systems with blockchain technologies, an area of current interest in the research community as well as industry. It will establish a strong background in cryptographic approaches to both voting and currency systems, while looking at Bitcoin, the blockchain, and E2E systems like Scantegrity.
