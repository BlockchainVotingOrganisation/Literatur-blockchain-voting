Here's most of the email I sent:


I’m halfway through the 3rd and final module. Here’s what I have left from the schedule:
  - The final lecture on ASIC-resistant mining puzzles (I’ve watched all the other lectures!)
  - The second half of chapter 9 of your thesis
  - Research into BitCongress, V-Initiative (sort of already done), and Bitcoin Foundation’s blockchain voting (sort of already done)

I read the first half of chapter 9, and enjoyed the sections on SureVote and JCJ. I think one of my reports will be on explaining JCJ, because I feel like I only 70% understand it (it’s just a lot to take in at once). Chapter 9 introduced some new terms I haven’t encountered before, including:

  - “Linkable group signature schemes”
  - “Plaintext equality test”
  - “Proxy oblivious transfer”
  - “Designated-verifier proof” (I think this is especially cool, but I haven’t seen any example of it in detail yet.)

There are some things I’m confused about in Chapter 9:

  - [pg. 154] “After the election, the mapping between codes and candidates can be shown to be correct without revealing it.” ... How does this work? I feel like I may encountered something like this when reading about Scantegrity (?) earlier in the term, but I don’t quite remember.
  - I was not able to figure out what a “linkable group signature scheme” or a “plaintext equality test” are. Is the former the same as: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature?
  - [pg. 155] in the section titled “Removing the out-of-band channel” ... “instead of the voter receiving her codes out-of-band, she receives them as CAPTCHAs” ... as in, hard to read text on top of images?
  - [pg. 155] in the section titled “Permutations” ... “The untrustworthy platform does not know the permutation , however unlike with code-voting, it can change the order and so this must be guarded against.” ... why would the untrustworthy platform attempt to change the order of an already randomized candidate order? Just for the sake of vandalism? I’m not sure I’ve understood correctly.
  - [pg. 155] in the section titled “Open-audit systems] ... “Helios does allow the voter (or anyone) to have their browser construct multiple encryptions of her ballot which she can challenge to be opening and audited.” ... but then how does ballot secrecy work? (I suspect I should just go read the paper.)
  - I have a lot of questions about the informal definition of coercion-resistance and JCJ, but there are so many I’m going to ask in a separate email that I’ll send later tonight.
