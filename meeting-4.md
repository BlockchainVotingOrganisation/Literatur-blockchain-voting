I haven't had a working keyboard at home for a few weeks, so a lot of my notes have been handwritten 
and now they need to be typed up. Here are my questions for the past readings:

**Chapter 9 of Clark's Thesis**

1.  How? --> "After the election, the mapping between codes and candidates can be shown to be correct without revealing it." (page 154)
2. What is a linkable group signature scheme?
3. Plaintext equaltiy test?
4. Proxy oblivious transfer? [Apparently, it is a new cryptographic primitive: "... that allows the election authority to
convert an encryption of the corresponding acknowledgement code for that voter and candidate without decrypting the 
submitted code."
5. What is the defintion _cryptographic primitive_? I kind of know, but I probably couldn't definite it on the spot.
6. How exactly does one received vote codes as _CAPTCHAs_, out-of-band? See citation [ABHL03] (page 155)
7.
