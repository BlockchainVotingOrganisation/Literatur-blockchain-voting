- New assignment format was approved.
  Topics I'm starting with include: CoinJoin, SPV, coloured coins, and re-encryption nets.
- I asked about Narayan's more _philosophical_ points about "trust minimization" and about 
how lack of trust is a starting position that we fix with (the hammer of) cryptography, and that it shouldn't
necessarily be out ultimate goal.
