- New assignment format was approved.
  Topics I'm starting with include: CoinJoin, SPV, coloured coins, and re-encryption nets.
- I asked about Narayan's more _philosophical_ points about "trust minimization" and about 
how lack of trust is a starting position that we fix with (the hammer of) cryptography, and that it shouldn't
necessarily be out ultimate goal. I said that I haven't really encountered such views when talking about cryptocurrencies (I have in other branches of cryptography), and asked for his opinions.

A summary of the response I got is: trust minimization has practical applications, namely a deployed system is more predictable if trusting 3rd parties is reduced. Trustless systems tend to be onerous and don't have great usability (for users). Also, the concept of "trust agility" was introduced: you have trusted parties, but you get to choose them and can easily switch who you are trusting. [Aside: this reminds me of escrow things with Bitcoin where you get to pick your mediator/judge.] "It seems to be a functional middle ground between trustless and â€œtrust who I say you need to trust"."

- Read this: https://moxie.org/blog/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity/ (the origin of trust agility?)
- Now I'm wondering ... what's the difference between security for human rights vs for the public interest?
