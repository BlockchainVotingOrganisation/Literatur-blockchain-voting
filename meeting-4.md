I haven't had a working keyboard at home for a few weeks, so a lot of my notes have been handwritten 
and now they need to be typed up. Here are my questions for the past readings:

**Chapter 9 of Clark's Thesis**

1.  How? --> "After the election, the mapping between codes and candidates can be shown to be correct without revealing it." (page 154)
2. What is a linkable group signature scheme?
3. Plaintext equaltiy test?
4. Proxy oblivious transfer? [Apparently, it is a new cryptographic primitive: "... that allows the election authority to
convert an encryption of the corresponding acknowledgement code for that voter and candidate without decrypting the 
submitted code."
5. What is the defintion _cryptographic primitive_? I kind of know, but I probably couldn't definite it on the spot.
6. How exactly does one received vote codes as _CAPTCHAs_, out-of-band? See citation [ABHL03] (page 155)
7. Regarding permutations: "it can reliably change the order and so this must be guarded against and so this must me guarded against." <---- why would any reorder the candidates? Just to cause chaos? Or maybe there's something I don't understand.
8. How does ballot secrecy work in this case? --> "Helios does allow the voter (or anyone) to have their browser construct multiple encryptions of her ballot which she can challenge to be opened and audited [Adi08]."
9. Page 156, in the informal defintion of coercion resistance ... what is a dummy strategy and why is it being used in **both** the heads and tails scenarios?
10. What is an ideal system?
11. Why do we need two sets of coin flips?
12. Why would we give the coercer a probability distribution? Even if we did, how could he "experience non-negligible success in determining if the voter is cooperating or not"?
13. "(1) if the flip is tails, the voter can always accomplish ... " <--- which coin flip?
14. What is a "designated verifier proof" ... or rather, I'd like to see an example of one.
15. Verifiable mix net? Ah! I still need to understand reencryption mix nets.
16. 

**Chapters 2-3 of Clark's Thesis**


**Miscellaneous**
1. What is this citation style called?
2. Fastest way to detect duplicates?
3. On channels as "bottlenecks" ...
