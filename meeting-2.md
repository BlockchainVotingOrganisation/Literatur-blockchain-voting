1. I kept asking about the paper that Chaum wrote in 1981, and was eventually told this: "No one uses Chaum-style mix nets anymore [in the context of voting, otherwise Tor would be an obvious exemption]. They use re-encryption mix nets instead."
2. Something about blockchain voting in Estonia. ( ... there always seems to be something going on in Estonia.)
3. I asked what the difference was between a secure vs an anonymous channel. A secure channel is comprised of two things: confidentiality and integrity. In an anonymous one, you do not know the sender or the receiver. In an untapable one one, nothing can be intercepted (this doesn't exist on the internet). An example of an untapable channel is if you see two people go into a room to have a meeting. You can't listen in on them, but you know they are communicating.
4. "Cievitas" ... added to my list of readings.
5. I asked about "anonymous credentials" and was told that credentials are actually a kind of complicated data structure. I didn't know that. I've only ever used the term "credentials" loosely. I stopped reading the paper on JCJ and have switched to #4 instead.
6. I've also been assigned "Selections" and "Internet Voting Systems" from his dissertion.
7. Recommended grad schools for this topic in Canada: Concordia, UBC (someone named Costa?). In America: MIT, rice (Wollvek?), Princeton (Felton), Berkely (Wagner), Michigan (J). There are also some places in Europe? Canada is my preference.
8. I asked how Inda's EVM's dealt with write-in votes and he said that they probably didn't. Also, NA is really the only place with write-ins. There are also essentially two types of write-ins: where you can write in anything or when a candidate didn't register in time and you are essentially picking a write-in from a list (which isn't all that different from it not being a write-in).
